This brief summary seeks to explore the relationship between certain socio-demographic variables and the voting patterns of the EU referendum held on 23 June 2016. A number of indicators have been examined including levels of higher education, age and median annual income. 

The EU referendum results for each Local Authority derive from the [Electoral Commission](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/electorate-and-count-information) and socio-demographic data are drawn from the [2011 Census](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census) and the [Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (2016)](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/workplace_population).

#### Higher education

There seems to be a very strong linear relationship between higher education and voting patterns in the EU referendum. Areas with high numbers of residents without degrees tended to vote Leave.
