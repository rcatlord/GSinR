### What is Markdown?

Developed by John Gruber in 2004, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a simple formatting syntax for plain text documents that can be easily converted into HTML.     

Markdown allows you to add formatting to plain text without the need to point and click in a word processor. With a few special characters, like asterisks for *emphasis*, you can focus on your writing without leaving the keyboard.

- It’s just plain text
- The formatting syntax is easy to remember
- And there’s no need to use a mouse
