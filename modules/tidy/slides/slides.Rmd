### Tidy data

Tidy data are structured for use in R and satisfy three rules:

1. Each variable must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell.

(Grolemund and Wickham 2017:149)

There are two of tidy data formats: wide and long.

### Why tidy data?

“Tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.”  
  – Hadley Wickham

### Data
```{r}
wide <- data.frame(Date = c("01-01-2017","02-01-2017","03-01-2017"),
                    Burglary = c(7,5,13),
                    Drugs = c(1,3,9),
                    Robbery = c(9,0,9),
                    Shoplifting = c(4,5,1))
wide
```

---
### `gather()`
For when your columns are values, not variables (wide to long)
```{r, comment='#'}
long <- gather(wide, category, count, -Date)
long
```

---
### `spread()`
For when observations have multiple rows (long to wide)
```{r, comment='#'}
wide <- spread(long, category, count)
wide
```

---
### `separate()`
Split columns
```{r, comment='#'}
split <- separate(wide, Date, c("Day", "Month", "Year"), sep = "-")
split
```

---
### `unite()`
Join columns
```{r, comment='#'}
united <- unite(split, Date, c(Day, Month, Year), sep = "-")
united
```
